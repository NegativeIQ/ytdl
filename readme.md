Simple proof of concept for realtime youtube download and convert to mp3 using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and ytdl-core.
Code is dirty and poorly stitched up (not even finished as it should be), most errors are not even handled correctly (its just proof of concept not really useful for anything).

If you want to give it a try clone and `npm install`. You will also need  [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and added to path variable. Use it as you see fit, but please respect dependencies licenses and youtube terms of use.

God bless [github user Fent](https://github.com/fent/) for ytdl and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for its piping system
